{#
    Landing page for the Kids Trainer Marketplace.  This view is inspired by
    polished two‑sided marketplaces such as Care.com and CoachUp.  It
    features a full‑width hero image with a call to action, a grid of
    popular sports categories, and a succinct value proposition.  Use
    ``url_for('static', path=...)`` to refer to images located in the
    ``static/images`` folder.  Adjust the list of categories and
    corresponding images as needed to match the sports offered in your
    marketplace.
